Problem Statement: With the growth of social media in recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the automatic characterisation of users based on the informal content they generate. Gender recognition is essential and critical for many applications in the commercial domains. Imagine that Twitter needs to push advertisements based on gender. As there are many fake accounts or accounts belonging to organisations, Twitter cannot rely on what the users themselves mention in their respective profile descriptions. Hence, Twitter would need to determine the gender of the profile based on user behaviour on the platform.

To enable this, train an algorithm to determine if a Twitter account belongs to a man or a woman or an organization. Build two models based on two different classification algorithms and compare the results. Choose any of the algorithms that you have been introduced to, throughout the course.  Moreover, feel free to proceed with any data preparation technique which suits the given dataset (whether it is covered in the course or not).

Data Description:

The dataset contains 20,000 rows, each with a particular username, a random tweet, account profile and image, location, link, sidebar colour and other miscellaneous data.

Note: You can think of a golden account as a verified account and relevant columns have "gold" either as a prefix or suffix. Twitter verifies the accounts of famous organisations and people so that Twitter users can be sure if the account is fake or not.
